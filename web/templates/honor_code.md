# Honor Code

All students participating in the class must agree to abide by the following code:

* I will register for only one account, unless expressly permitted to register for additional accounts by Coursera.
* My answers to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments will be my own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).
* I will not make solutions to homework, quizzes, exams, projects, and other assignments available to anyone else (except to the extent an assignment explicitly permits sharing solutions). This includes both solutions written by me, as well as any solutions provided by the course staff or others.
* I will not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve my results or dishonestly improve or hurt the results of others.
