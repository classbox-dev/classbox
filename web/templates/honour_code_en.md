* I will not make the project source code available to anyone else.
* I will not use the Internet for copying someone else's source code, only for reference and solution ideas.
* I will not engage in any other form of cheating to influence my results or the results of others.
* I do understand that my results may be adjusted should I be found red-handed during random cheating checks.

**[Continue](..)**
